    <h3>0.Introduce Word Blitz</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Word Blitz</b> is a game from Facebook Messenger. Everyone could play it on your phone or computer as long as you have a Facebook account.
        The game is simple. Given a 4x4 list of characters, connect characters that can make a word. Find as many word combinations as possible in 2 minutes.
    </p>

    <h3>1.Image detection</h3>
    <p>
        In order to make the bot play, we have first input the character list. So the program could start to find conbinations.<br>
        At first, I have to manually input that 16 characters. But that is really tiring. So I decide to make the program collect the input automaticlly.<br><br>
        I wrote the code in Python3. That way I can use OCR modules easily.<br>

            alt=""
            title=""
        />
    </p>

    <h3>2.Pathfiding Algorithm</h3>
    <p>
        I used recursion in the code. Create all the possible combinations of characters. Then check if the conbination is in the dictionary.<br>
        This is a bad way to find the answer. But is fast enough to check all the possible answer in 2 minutes.<br>
        <img
            src="images/3566.png"
            alt=""
            title=""
        />
        <br>This is the end of the dictionaty, there are 170000+ possible words.
    </p>

    <h3>3.Auto Mouse Input</h3>
    <p>
        This module "PyMouse" in Python can move your mouse and simulate click actions.<br>
        Sadly, we are simulating mouse actions to send input to the browser. This is way slower then just sending info by packets.
        <br>But there's no such api exists. So I had to do this.
        <br>
        <img
            src="images/35662.png"
            alt=""
            title=""
        />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>And that's how the bot was made!</p>
