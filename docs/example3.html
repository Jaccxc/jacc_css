            <h3>0.Introducing Word Blitz</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Word Blitz</b> is a game from Facebook Messenger. Everyone could play it on your phone or computer as long as you have a Facebook account.
                The game is simple. Given a 4x4 list of characters, connect characters that can make a word. Find as many word combinations as possible in 2 minutes.
            </p>


            <h3>1.Image detection</h3>
            <p>
                In order to make the bot play, we have first input the character list. So the program could start to find conbinations.<br>
                At first, I have to manually input that 16 characters. But that is really tiring. So I decide to make the program collect the input automaticlly.<br><br>
                I wrote the code in Python3. That way I can use OCR modules easily.<br>
                <img src="images/4244.png"
                     alt=""
                     title="" />
            </p>

            <h3>2.Pathfinding Algorithm</h3>
            <p>
                I used recursion in the code. Create all the possible combinations of characters. Then check if the conbination is in the dictionary.<br>
                This is a bad way to find the answer. But is fast enough to check all the possible answer in 2 minutes.<br>
                <img src="images/3566.png"
                     alt=""
                     title="" />
                <br>This is the end of the dictionaty, there are 170000+ possible words.
            </p>

            <h3>3.Auto Mouse Input</h3>
            <p>
                This module "PyMouse" in Python can move your mouse and simulate click actions.<br>
                Sadly, we are simulating mouse actions to send input to the browser. This is way slower then just sending info by packets.
                <br>But there's no such api exists. So I had to do this.
                <br>
                <img src="images/35662.png"
                     alt=""
                     title="" />
            </p>
            
            <p>And that's how the bot was made!</p>
